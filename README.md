# file-frontend

A micro-service that acts as a frontend for functionaltiy revolving around uploading files to file hosting
providers.

The main reason this is here however is to allow me to integrate it with docker on a virtual machine. More practice
than anything else.

## Running

Can use a virtualenv, although there isn't much here for now. Quickest way is to use python ./manage.py runserver.
